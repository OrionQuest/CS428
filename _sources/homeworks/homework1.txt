Homework #1
===========

For all programming assignments, please turn in your code along with your
solution. For all hardware assignments, please provide as much details on your
implementation, along with a video of the final setup in action. Submissions should be made on Sakai,
and must be in the form of a single PDF file that includes all descriptions/code, and a video file.

.. topic:: Problem 1

    Write an OpenGL program to display a rotating `pinwheel <../images/pinwheel.png>`_. The simplest implementation
    would use a 2D setup. Extra credit points can be earned by making use of texture
    maps on top of the pinwheel, making a 3D model that is more realistic, or
    attempting a more complex scene, such as a `ferris wheel <https://images.dailyhive.com/20171121101458/Ferris-wheel-Lower-Lonsdale-BIA.jpg>`_.

.. topic:: Problem 2

    Implement a traffic light circuit using the `Arduino <https://www.arduino.cc/>`_ board for two perpendicular lanes. This should make use of six LEDs
    (2 red, 2 blue, and 2 green), and two switches. Pressing a switch indicates
    that cars have been waiting in one lane, so the other lane (if green),
    should become yellow and then red. Vice-versa for the opposite situation.
    The circuit should enforce that only one lane stays green, and the other red, at all times.
