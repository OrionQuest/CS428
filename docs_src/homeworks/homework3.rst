Homework #3
===========

For all programming assignments, please turn in your code along with your
solution. Submissions should be made on Sakai, and must include all material
in a single ZIP file with all descriptions/code, and a video file.

.. topic:: Problem 1

    Design and implement an animation sequence for rigid body dynamics with collisions and contact. You can use
    a Physics engine such as:

    * `Bullet Physics <https://pybullet.org/wordpress/>`_
    * `Open Dynamics Engine <https://www.ode.org/>`_
    * `MuJoCo <http://www.mujoco.org/>`_
    * `Chrono <https://projectchrono.org/>`_

    or any other open-source engine of your choice. All frames in the animation
    sequence should be rendered using a rendering engine, such as:

    * `Blender <https://www.blender.org/>`_
    * `PBRT <https://pbrt.org/>`_
    * `RenderMan <https://renderman.pixar.com/>`_

    or any other rendering engine of your choice. Extra credit will be given to
    students depending on the level of creativity in designing the scene, and rendering
    the video.
