CS428: Introduction to Computer Graphics
========================================

Welcome to CS 428! This course is an introduction to Computer Graphics, and covers
a wide range of topics such as geometric modeling, physics-based rendering, and
microcontroller programming. The class begins with an introduction to various software
suites, and each successive lecture builds upon the concepts covered in the
previous class.

| **Time:** 5:00PM - 6:20PM, Mondays/Wednesdays, Spring 2019
| **Place:** CoRE 101, Busch Campus

| **Instructor:** `Mridul Aanjaneya <https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ma635/>`_
| **Office:** CBIM Room 18
| **Office hours:** Monday/Wednesday (1PM - 2PM)
| **Email:** mridul.aanjaneya@rutgers.edu

| **Graders:** Shuya Zhao, Mingxiao Liu, Yixuan Duan
| **Office:** Hill 264A
| **Office hours:** Tuesday (10AM - 12PM)

**Email Policy:** You are welcome to email the instructor about class-related
issues. Please start your subject line with \"**CS 428:**\". However, please do
not always count on an immediate reply. Although most questions will be answered
quickly, in the worst case you will receive a reply during (or shortly after)
the instructors' *next* scheduled office hours.

**Grading Policy:** Grades will be awarded based on class participation, homeworks, and a term project.
The final grade will be computed as follows:

    70% x (homeworks) + 25% x (term project) + 5% x (class participation)

**Class participation:** Participation in class will be
evaluated based on the number of classes attended, enthusiasm for answering the
instructor's questions, and willingness to help other students.

**Collaboration:** Students are encouraged to form teams of two for the term project.
However, **all homework must be done individually by each student**.

**Typing resources:** All homework should be typed. Students can choose their favorite
platform for typing out their homework, some commonly used softwares are
`Microsoft Word <https://products.office.com/en-us/word>`_, `LaTeX <https://www.latex-project.org/get/>`_,
and `LyX <http://www.lyx.org/>`_. Thanks to a former student, Alex Ames, here is
a `LyX guide <https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ma635/courses/cs412-s15/lyx_guide/lyx_tips.pdf>`_
and associated `source files <https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ma635/courses/cs412-s15/lyx_guide/lyx_tips.zip>`_
